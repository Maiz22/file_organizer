Developed a File Organizer application utilizing the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture with Python's Tkinter and Ttkbootstrap. This application allows users to specify a path for reorganization, set custom file types and extensions, or use default settings. Users can define destination paths for each file type, enabling efficient file management. The Model component stores user configurations, which can be reset to default settings as needed. The View is constructed with Tkinter, using reusable widgets for a streamlined interface. The Controller manages interactions between the View and Model, facilitating the creation of new setups and the movement of files.
