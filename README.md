# File Organizer

This is a File Organizer application built with Python using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. The user interface (view) is created with Tkinter and Ttkbootstrap. The data models are defined using the Pydantic module. A simple JSON file is used to store data, as the amount of data is small. The controller connects the user interface with the data by interacting with both the view and the models, including a basic "CRUD" (Create, Read, Update, Delete) layer.<br>
The application allows users to set a "Base Path" for reorganizing files. They can define custom file types and extensions (file endings) or use the default settings. Users can also set destination folders for each file type, making file management more efficient. User settings are saved in a JSON file and can be reset to default if needed. The user interface (View) is built using reusable widgets to keep the layout clean and consistent.
