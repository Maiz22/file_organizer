File Organizer created in a MVC(Model View Controller) architecture using pythons tkinter bootstrap. The user is able to set a path which he/she wants to reorganize. The user can set data types with custom endings or use the defaul datatypes and endings. For every datatype a path can be set to which the files shall be moved to. The Model is used to store the users setup. By pressing reset this user data can be restored and the default seupt is set. The View is created with tkinter (ttkboostrap) by creating reusable widgets. The Controller is managing the interaction between View and Model, creating new setups and moving the files.
